# fund clusters

A lot of clustering relies on the co-variance matrix of fund returns.

Here we compute the funds' investment characteristics and use these as features on which to perform a kmeans analysis and look for new funds exhibiting similar investment characteristics as our existing holdings.

Then check the correlations to existing funds and assess the number of investment bets.
